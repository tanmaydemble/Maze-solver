# Maze Game Instructions

Welcome to our Maze Game, where you can navigate, solve, and interact with dynamically generated mazes. Once the maze animation completes, it's ready for your input and exploration. Here's how you can interact with the maze:

## Getting Started
Download: To play the game, download the JAR file from our website.

## Controls

- **B**: Press 'B' to initiate a Breadth-First Search algorithm. This will automatically find a path through the maze using this strategy.
- **D**: Press 'D' to start a Depth-First Search. Watch as the game explores deeper paths first to find the maze solution.
- **R**: Press 'R' to refresh the current board. This resets any progress or paths you've made in the current maze.
- **N**: Press 'N' to generate a new random board. Each board is a unique challenge!
- **S**: Press 'S' to toggle the visibility of the steps taken to solve the maze. This can be a great learning tool to understand how the algorithms work.
- **M**: Press 'M' to toggle Manual Mode. In this mode, you can use the arrow keys to navigate through the maze yourself. Press 'M' again to exit Manual Mode.
- **H**: Press 'H' to create a maze that favors horizontal pathways. This adds an interesting twist and a new kind of challenge.
- **V**: Press 'V' to generate a maze with a preference for vertical pathways. See how this changes your strategy and approach to solving the maze.

## Game Modes

- **Automatic Mode**: The game solves the maze for you using either Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search algorithms.
- **Manual Mode**: You control the movement within the maze using the arrow keys. Toggle this mode on and off by pressing 'M'.

## Tips

- Experiment with different controls to fully enjoy and understand the game dynamics.
- Challenge yourself with different types of mazes by using the 'H' and 'V' keys.

We hope you enjoy navigating through the mazes as much as we enjoyed creating them. Happy gaming!
